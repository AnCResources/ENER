# Multidisciplinary/Education Focused

## Educational Researcher

_<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/EDR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Educational Researcher</a>_ publishes scholarly articles that are of general significance to the education research community and that come from a wide range of areas of education research and related disciplines. _ER_ aims to make major programmatic research and new findings of broad importance widely accessible. It is published nine times per year.
_ER_ encourages submissions of three types of research articles-feature articles, reviews/essays, and briefs.

Feature Articles present important new research results of broad significance. Feature articles should include an abstract, an introductory paragraph, up to five figures or tables, and up to 40 references, with text totaling no more than 5,000 words. Significant feature articles may be somewhat longer than 5,000 words at the discretion of the editors. Methods need to be sufficiently presented in research article to warrant results, but information should usually be included in supplementary online material to further support the paper's conclusions. All Feature Articles undergo peer review; they may be solicited or unsolicited.

## International Journal of Educational Research 

The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-educational-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Journal of Educational Research</a> publishes research papers in the field of Education. Papers published in IJER address themes of major interest to researchers, practitioners, and policy makers working in different international contexts. Work must be of a quality and context that the Editorial Board think would be of interest to an international readership. The aims and scope of the journals are to:

Publish high quality papers that are of international significance in terms of design and/or findings;

Publish papers on topics that are of international significance across educational contexts and which discuss explicitly how the findings of the paper can inform research, policy, or practice beyond the context in which the original work is undertaken;

Promote greater equality and representation in academic publishing and be inclusive of a variety of knowledge traditions. This means that papers that challenge established paradigms and present alternative approaches to educational research are of special interest to us;

Encourage collaboration by international teams of researchers to create special issues on these topics;

Publish papers that are accessible to a wide audience of educationalists with varied backgrounds.

## International Journal of Educational Research Open

The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-educational-research-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> International Journal of Educational Research Open </a> (IJEDRO) is a companion title of the International Journal of Educational Research (IJER). IJEDRO is an open access, peer-reviewed journal which draws contributions from a wide community of international and interdisciplinary researchers across the field of educational research. We seek contributions that present innovative application of theories, conceptual frameworks and research methodologies, and which inform research, policy and practice beyond the context in which the original work is undertaken.

The International Journal of Educational Research Open so so-named to reflect our international facing publication portfolio and readership. Contributions do not need to be comparative (in the sense of comparing aspects of education in different countries or cultures) or report research carried out in just one location or cultural setting. However, contributions to the International Journal of Educational Research Open need to be thought-provoking, contribute to the educational research field, and inspire international, interdisciplinary readership. Therefore, contributions must have the following features:

- Clear communication about the research findings or arguments
- Critical demonstration of how the literature critically relates to the topic researched
- Strong theoretical, conceptual or philosophical framing
- Clearly explained design and analysis, allowing replication of the study in other (international) contexts
- Critical analysis, recommendations and implications for further research, policy and practice in an international context

The journal supports equality, inclusion and diversity in research and education, within our editorial team, and among author and reviewer networks. As part of our commitment to open access and the values of inclusion, the journal encourages, in particular, early career researchers who take a fresh approach to research methodologies to submit their contributions, provided they support the journal's aims and scope.

Note that we accept well-structured conceptual or theoretical manuscripts. This sets IJEDRO slightly apart from IJER as IJER tends to have a empirical expectations. IJEDRO will also accept evidence syntheses, but the research must have taken a systematic approach to the selection and presentation of evidence. Like IJER, we will also take protocols for work that will be undertaken in the future, but where data is yet to be generated. These will normally be protocols for randomised controlled trials or quasi-experimental trials, or for evidence syntheses. We will also look at protocols for qualitative designed work.

## International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education

The aim of the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tqse20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education</a> (popularly known as QSE) is to enhance the practice and theory of qualitative research in education, with "education" defined in the broadest possible sense, including non-school settings.

The journal publishes peer-reviewed empirical research focused on critical issues of racism (including whiteness, white racism, and white supremacy), capitalism and its class structure (including critiques of neoliberalism), gender and gender identity, heterosexism and homophobia, LGBTQI/queer issues, home culture and language biases, immigration xenophobia, domination, and other issues of oppression and exclusion.

Research may employ a variety of qualitative methods and approaches, such as ethnography, grounded theory, life history, case study, curriculum criticism, policy studies, narrative, ethnomethodology, social/educational critique, phenomenology, deconstruction, genealogy and autoethnography, amongst others. In addition, innovative or provocative approaches to qualitative research as well as the way research is reported are encouraged. We also welcome theoretical papers, including discussions of ontology, epistemology, methodology, or ethics from a broad range of perspectives.

## Research in Higher Education

<a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research in Higher Education</a> is a journal that publishes empirical research on postsecondary education. The journal is open to studies using a wide range of methods, but has particular interest in studies that apply advanced quantitative research methods to issues in postsecondary education or address postsecondary education policy issues. Authors should directly address why their analytic sample is appropriate for addressing their research questions and how the study's findings could be applicable to other contexts, situations, times, and populations.

Among the topics of interest to the journal are: access and retention; student success; equity; faculty issues; institutional productivity and assessment; postsecondary education governance; curriculum and instruction; state and federal higher education policy; and financing of postsecondary education. The journal encourages submissions from scholars in disciplines outside of higher education, and studies from outside the United States that address issues that are of interest to the readership. To be considered a contribution to this journal, manuscripts should engage with literature published in journals in the field of higher education and draw out the implications of the results for higher education. The journal will on occasion publish short notes of a methodological nature, literature reviews of topics pertaining to postsecondary research, and "research and practice" studies illustrating how postsecondary research can inform decision making.


Open to studies using a wide range of methods, with a special interest in advanced quantitative research methods.
Covers topics such as student access, retention, success, faculty issues, institutional assessment, and higher education policy.
Encourages submissions from scholars in disciplines outside of higher education.
Publishes notes of a methodological nature, literature reviews and 'research and practice' studies.
Aims to inform decision-making in postsecondary education policy and administration.

## Studies in Higher Education

<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/cshe20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies in Higher Education</a> is a leading international journal publishing research-based articles dealing with higher education issues from either a disciplinary or multi-disciplinary perspective. Empirical, theoretical and conceptual articles of significant originality will be considered. Manuscripts are expected to be grounded in the higher education literature and contribute to it through substantive new empirical findings or novel insights.

The Journal welcomes contributions that seek to enhance understanding of higher education policy, institutional management and performance, teaching and learning, and the contribution of higher education to society and the economy. Comparative studies and analysis of inter-system and cross-national issues are particularly welcomed, as are those addressing global and international themes. The Journal also annually publishes two special issues on topics of international significance to higher education

As interest in research on higher education has expanded internationally, SHE has experienced a remarkable growth in the number of submissions. As a result, our rejection rate is higher than we, reviewers, and most importantly authors would ideally like. To try and mitigate this we encourage prospective authors whose manuscripts deal with more circumscribed topics and issues of interest to a local or regional audience within a particular national context to consider a specialist journal which might be a more suitable outlet for their work.

## Teaching in Higher Education

<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/cthe20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teaching in Higher Education</a> has become an internationally recognised field, which is more than ever open to multiple forms of contestation. However, the intellectual challenge which teaching presents has been inadequately acknowledged and theorised in higher education.

Teaching in Higher Education seeks to develop a discourse of teaching and learning which transcends disciplinary boundaries and specialisms whilst drawing upon the rigour of a range of disciplines. It takes a view of learning which entails concepts of transformation and critique in relation to dominant traditions and visions. It will therefore appeal to those who wish to explore how such aims might be realised through a commitment to teaching in a variety of cultural and disciplinary contexts represented in higher education internationally.

The journal welcomes significant contributions that aim to develop sustained reflection, investigation and critique, and that critically identify new agendas for research, for example by: 
- examining the impact on teaching exerted by wider contextual factors such as policy, funding, institutional change and the expectations of society;
- developing conceptual analyses of pedagogical issues and debates, such as authority, power, assessment and the nature of understanding;
- exploring the various values which underlie teaching including those concerned with social and epistemic justice, and equity;
- offering critical accounts of lived experiences of higher education pedagogies which bring together theory and practice.
