# Multidisciplinary/Education Focused

## Educational Researcher

_<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/EDR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Educational Researcher</a>_ publishes scholarly articles that are of general significance to the education research community and that come from a wide range of areas of education research and related disciplines. _ER_ aims to make major programmatic research and new findings of broad importance widely accessible. It is published nine times per year.
_ER_ encourages submissions of three types of research articles-feature articles, reviews/essays, and briefs.

Feature Articles present important new research results of broad significance. Feature articles should include an abstract, an introductory paragraph, up to five figures or tables, and up to 40 references, with text totaling no more than 5,000 words. Significant feature articles may be somewhat longer than 5,000 words at the discretion of the editors. Methods need to be sufficiently presented in research article to warrant results, but information should usually be included in supplementary online material to further support the paper's conclusions. All Feature Articles undergo peer review; they may be solicited or unsolicited.

## International Journal of Educational Research 

The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-educational-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Journal of Educational Research</a> publishes research papers in the field of Education. Papers published in IJER address themes of major interest to researchers, practitioners, and policy makers working in different international contexts. Work must be of a quality and context that the Editorial Board think would be of interest to an international readership. The aims and scope of the journals are to:

Publish high quality papers that are of international significance in terms of design and/or findings;

Publish papers on topics that are of international significance across educational contexts and which discuss explicitly how the findings of the paper can inform research, policy, or practice beyond the context in which the original work is undertaken;

Promote greater equality and representation in academic publishing and be inclusive of a variety of knowledge traditions. This means that papers that challenge established paradigms and present alternative approaches to educational research are of special interest to us;

Encourage collaboration by international teams of researchers to create special issues on these topics;

Publish papers that are accessible to a wide audience of educationalists with varied backgrounds.

## International Journal of Educational Research Open

The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-educational-research-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> International Journal of Educational Research Open </a> (IJEDRO) is a companion title of the International Journal of Educational Research (IJER). IJEDRO is an open access, peer-reviewed journal which draws contributions from a wide community of international and interdisciplinary researchers across the field of educational research. We seek contributions that present innovative application of theories, conceptual frameworks and research methodologies, and which inform research, policy and practice beyond the context in which the original work is undertaken.

The International Journal of Educational Research Open so so-named to reflect our international facing publication portfolio and readership. Contributions do not need to be comparative (in the sense of comparing aspects of education in different countries or cultures) or report research carried out in just one location or cultural setting. However, contributions to the International Journal of Educational Research Open need to be thought-provoking, contribute to the educational research field, and inspire international, interdisciplinary readership. Therefore, contributions must have the following features:

- Clear communication about the research findings or arguments
- Critical demonstration of how the literature critically relates to the topic researched
- Strong theoretical, conceptual or philosophical framing
- Clearly explained design and analysis, allowing replication of the study in other (international) contexts
- Critical analysis, recommendations and implications for further research, policy and practice in an international context

The journal supports equality, inclusion and diversity in research and education, within our editorial team, and among author and reviewer networks. As part of our commitment to open access and the values of inclusion, the journal encourages, in particular, early career researchers who take a fresh approach to research methodologies to submit their contributions, provided they support the journal's aims and scope.

Note that we accept well-structured conceptual or theoretical manuscripts. This sets IJEDRO slightly apart from IJER as IJER tends to have a empirical expectations. IJEDRO will also accept evidence syntheses, but the research must have taken a systematic approach to the selection and presentation of evidence. Like IJER, we will also take protocols for work that will be undertaken in the future, but where data is yet to be generated. These will normally be protocols for randomised controlled trials or quasi-experimental trials, or for evidence syntheses. We will also look at protocols for qualitative designed work.

## International Journal of STEM Education

The <a href="https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Journal of STEM Education</a> is a multidisciplinary journal in subject-content education that focuses on the study of teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is being established as a brand new, forward looking journal in the field of education. As a peer-reviewed journal, it is positioned to promote research and educational development in the rapidly evolving field of STEM education around the world.

The International Journal of STEM Education provides a unique platform for sharing research regarding, among other topics, the design and implementation of technology-rich learning environments, innovative pedagogies, and curricula in STEM education that promote successful learning in Pre K-16 levels including teacher education. We are also interested in studies that address specific challenges in improving students’ achievement, approaches used to motivate and engage students, and lessons learned from changes in curriculum and instruction in STEM education. The journal encourages translational STEM education research that bridges research and educational policy and practice for STEM education improvement.
